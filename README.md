# Hola! 👋

I'm **Ezequiel** (he/him). Welcome to my GitHub profile.

I'm a programmer passionate about creating impactful solutions for NGOs and social projects. My work often combines technology and creativity, aiming to empower organizations and drive positive change. I’m always open to collaborations that align with these values.

Feel free to explore my projects and reach out if you'd like to connect or work together!

## 🌱 Currently Learning:

## 🌍 My Goal
I aim to apply programming to solve societal issues. I'm particularly keen on assisting NGOs that lack the resources for a digital presence. If you're an organization in need, or know one that could benefit from digital solutions, please feel free to reach out.

Looking forward to seeing you in the code and making a difference together! 😉
