## 🌍 My Goal
I aim to apply programming to solve societal issues. I'm particularly keen on assisting NGOs that lack the resources for a digital presence. If you're an organization in need, or know one that could benefit from digital solutions, please feel free to reach out. Now starting my way with YUNOHOST

Looking forward to seeing you in the code and making a difference together! 😉
